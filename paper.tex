\begin{abstract}
Traditional NBA roster analysis predominantly examines individual player performance metrics and aggregate salary distributions, potentially overlooking the complex relational dynamics that emerge through shared court time. This research explores the application of network theory to understand how roster construction influences team performance stability and playoff success. We propose modeling NBA rosters as salary-weighted network graphs, where players serve as nodes (scaled by salary) and edges represent actual shared on-court minutes during game situations. This framework enables investigation of roster "geometry" through established graph theory metrics including salary inequality measures, network density, modularity, and centralization patterns. Our methodology examines whether network topology can predict playoff performance by analyzing teams across the spectrum of postseason outcomes. To explore optimal roster construction, we develop synthetic roster generation algorithms operating under realistic salary cap constraints, allowing comparison between actual team configurations and theoretically optimal networks. Additionally, we implement robustness simulations to quantify how different roster structures withstand systematic player removal scenarios. This exploratory analysis seeks to establish whether network-theoretic approaches can provide meaningful insights into roster construction strategies. The research contributes to the growing field of sports network analysis while investigating practical applications for NBA front offices seeking data-driven roster construction methodologies.

\section{Introduction}

The National Basketball Association (NBA) operates under a complex salary cap system that constrains how teams can allocate financial resources across their rosters. While traditional sports analytics has extensively studied individual player performance metrics and aggregate payroll management strategies, there remains a significant gap in understanding how the \textit{relational structure} of roster construction influences team performance and resilience to disruptions.

Current approaches to roster evaluation typically treat players as independent units, focusing on individual statistics, advanced metrics like Player Efficiency Rating (PER), and Win Shares. However, basketball is fundamentally a collaborative sport where player interactions, on-court chemistry, and complementary skill sets create emergent team-level properties that cannot be captured through additive individual metrics alone. The question arises: can we develop a more sophisticated framework for understanding how roster composition affects team performance stability?

This research introduces a network-theoretic approach to NBA roster analysis, treating teams as complex systems where players represent nodes and their on-court interactions form weighted edges based on shared playing time. By modeling rosters as salary-weighted graphs, we can examine the \textit{geometry} of team construction through established network science metrics including centralization, modularity, and assortativity measures.

Our framework addresses three fundamental questions in roster construction: (1) Do successful teams exhibit distinct network topological properties compared to underperforming teams? (2) How does the spatial distribution of salary allocation within the network correlate with team resilience to player disruptions such as injuries or trades? (3) Can network-based metrics provide predictive insights for playoff performance that complement traditional basketball analytics?

To explore these questions, we develop a comprehensive analysis pipeline that integrates real NBA data with robustness simulations and synthetic roster generation. Our approach examines teams across diverse performance outcomes, from championship winners to playoff non-qualifiers, seeking to identify network signatures of successful roster construction.

The contributions of this work are threefold: we establish a novel theoretical framework for roster analysis using network science principles, demonstrate its application using authentic NBA data from the 2023-24 season, and provide an open-source reproducible research pipeline for broader adoption in sports analytics research.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Network Analysis in Sports}

Network theory has found increasing application in sports analytics, particularly in understanding team dynamics and player interactions. Fewell et al. \cite{fewell2012basketball} pioneered the application of network analysis to basketball by examining passing networks and identifying distinct team styles based on network topology. Their work demonstrated that ball movement patterns could be quantified using graph theory metrics, revealing insights into team coordination and strategy effectiveness.

Subsequent research has explored various aspects of sports networks. Clemente et al. \cite{clemente2015general} provided a comprehensive review of network analysis applications across multiple sports, highlighting the versatility of graph-theoretic approaches in understanding team performance. In soccer, Grund \cite{grund2012network} analyzed passing networks to understand team cohesion and tactical formations, while Duch et al. \cite{duch2010quantifying} used network centrality measures to identify key players and predict match outcomes.

\subsection{Salary Cap Analysis and Roster Construction}

Traditional NBA salary cap research has focused primarily on aggregate spending patterns and their correlation with team success. Berri and Schmidt \cite{berri2010wages} examined the relationship between payroll and performance, finding that higher spending correlates with better records but with diminishing returns. Fort and Quirk \cite{fort1995cross} analyzed competitive balance under salary cap constraints, demonstrating how financial restrictions influence league parity.

More recent work has explored optimal roster construction under budget constraints. Alamar and Mehrotra \cite{alamar2011sports} developed linear programming approaches for player selection, while Berman et al. \cite{berman2015optimal} examined portfolio theory applications to roster management. However, these approaches typically treat player values as independent, ignoring the relational aspects of team chemistry and on-court synergies.

\subsection{Robustness and Resilience in Networks}

The concept of network robustness has been extensively studied in various domains, from infrastructure systems to biological networks. Albert et al. \cite{albert2000error} established foundational principles for understanding how networks respond to node removal, demonstrating that scale-free networks exhibit different vulnerabilities to random versus targeted attacks.

In sports contexts, McGarry et al. \cite{mcgarry2002sport} examined team resilience from a dynamical systems perspective, while Yamamoto and Yokoyama \cite{yamamoto2011common} analyzed how team performance degrades when key players are unavailable. However, limited work has specifically applied network robustness theory to roster construction and salary allocation strategies.

\subsection{Gaps in Current Research}

While existing literature has explored network analysis in basketball and salary cap optimization separately, no prior work has systematically combined these approaches to understand roster geometry and resilience. Furthermore, most basketball network studies focus on in-game passing patterns rather than roster-level structural properties determined by player composition and salary allocation. This research addresses these gaps by developing an integrated framework that treats roster construction as a network design problem under financial constraints.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Collection and Preprocessing}

Our analysis utilizes authentic NBA data from the 2023-24 regular season, focusing on four teams representing diverse playoff outcomes: the Atlanta Hawks (missed playoffs), Boston Celtics (NBA champions), Los Angeles Lakers (first round exit), and Golden State Warriors (second round exit). This selection provides variation in performance outcomes while maintaining manageable computational scope for detailed analysis.

\subsubsection{Salary Data}

Player salary information was collected from official NBA sources and Spotrac.com, ensuring accuracy for the 2023-24 season. We obtained contract values for all rostered players, excluding two-way contracts and minimum salary exceptions that do not significantly impact network structure. Salary data underwent standardization and validation to ensure consistency across teams.

\subsubsection{Lineup and Playing Time Data}

Shared on-court time data was extracted using the NBA's official API through the \texttt{nba\_api} Python package. For each team, we collected minute-by-minute lineup information for all regular season games, aggregating shared playing time between every pair of teammates. This data forms the foundation for edge weights in our network representations.

Data preprocessing involved filtering out garbage time minutes (defined as periods when the score differential exceeds 20 points in the final quarter) and normalizing shared minutes to account for different game totals and injury-related absences.

\subsection{Network Construction}

\subsubsection{Node Representation}

Each player $p_i$ in a roster is represented as a node with attributes including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Salary weight $s_i$: Annual contract value normalized by team total
    \item Position designation $pos_i$: Primary playing position
    \item Usage rate $u_i$: Percentage of team possessions used when on court
\end{itemize}

Node size in visualizations corresponds to salary weight, providing immediate visual indication of financial allocation across the roster.

\subsubsection{Edge Construction}

Edges between players $p_i$ and $p_j$ are weighted by their shared on-court time:
$$w_{ij} = \frac{\text{Minutes}_{ij}}{\text{Max}(\text{Minutes}_{i}, \text{Minutes}_{j})}$$

This normalization ensures that edge weights remain bounded between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating players who frequently share the court relative to their individual playing time.

\subsubsection{Network Metrics}

For each team's roster network $G = (V, E)$, we compute the following topological measures:

\textbf{Salary Gini Coefficient:} Measures inequality in salary distribution using the standard Gini formula:
$$G = \frac{2\sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot s_i}{n \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i} - \frac{n+1}{n}$$

\textbf{Network Density:} Proportion of possible edges that exist in the network:
$$\rho = \frac{2|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}$$

\textbf{Modularity:} Measures the strength of community structure within the roster:
$$Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{ij} \left[ A_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \right] \delta(c_i, c_j)$$

\textbf{Centralization Index:} Quantifies how concentrated connectivity is around specific players:
$$C = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} [C_D(p^*) - C_D(p_i)]}{(n-1)(n-2)}$$

\textbf{Salary-weighted Assortativity:} Measures tendency for high-salary players to connect with similar players:
$$r = \frac{\sum_{ij} s_i s_j (A_{ij} - k_i k_j / 2m)}{\sum_{ij} s_i (k_i - k_i k_j / 2m)}$$

\subsection{Robustness Simulation}

To quantify roster resilience, we implement systematic node removal simulations that model various disruption scenarios:

\subsubsection{Disruption Scenarios}

\textbf{Single Star Removal:} Remove the highest-paid player (typically the team's primary star) and measure network property changes.

\textbf{Role Player Disruption:} Remove players in the 40th-80th salary percentiles who often provide crucial role player functionality.

\textbf{Depth Chart Disruption:} Remove multiple players from the same position group to simulate position-specific injuries.

\textbf{Community Disruption:} Identify network communities using modularity optimization and remove key community connectors.

\subsubsection{Resilience Metrics}

For each disruption scenario, we compute:
$$R_{scenario} = 1 - \frac{|\Delta \Phi|}{\Phi_{original}}$$

where $\Phi$ represents a composite performance metric combining network density, efficiency measures, and connectivity statistics. Higher resilience scores indicate networks that maintain structural integrity despite player removal.

\subsection{Synthetic Roster Generation}

To establish benchmarks for optimal roster construction, we develop algorithms that generate synthetic rosters under realistic constraints:

\subsubsection{Optimization Framework}

Given salary cap $S_{cap}$, position requirements $P_{req}$, and player pool $\mathcal{P}$, we solve:

\begin{align}
\max & \quad f(G) \\
\text{s.t.} & \quad \sum_{i \in V} s_i \leq S_{cap} \\
& \quad |V \cap P_j| \geq P_{req}(j) \quad \forall j \in \{PG, SG, SF, PF, C\} \\
& \quad |V| = 15
\end{align}

where $f(G)$ is an objective function combining network topology metrics and estimated team performance indicators.

\subsubsection{Evolutionary Algorithm}

We employ a genetic algorithm approach with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Population size: 100 synthetic rosters
    \item Selection: Tournament selection based on fitness function
    \item Crossover: Position-aware player swapping between parent rosters
    \item Mutation: Random player substitutions within salary constraints
    \item Generations: 500 iterations with convergence monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

Correlation analysis examines relationships between network metrics and playoff outcomes using both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. Given the small sample size, we employ bootstrap resampling to generate confidence intervals and assess statistical significance.

For classification tasks, we utilize Random Forest models with cross-validation adapted for small datasets. Feature importance analysis identifies which network metrics contribute most to playoff success prediction.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Theoretical Implications}

The application of network theory to NBA roster analysis reveals several important theoretical insights about team construction principles. Unlike traditional approaches that treat players as independent assets, our network framework captures the emergent properties that arise from player interactions and complementary skill sets. This perspective suggests that roster value cannot be simply aggregated from individual player contributions but must account for relational dynamics.

The concept of roster "geometry" provides a novel lens for understanding team construction. Just as geometric shapes have inherent structural properties that influence their behavior under stress, roster networks exhibit topological characteristics that determine their resilience to disruptions. Teams with distributed salary allocation and robust connectivity patterns demonstrate superior stability when facing player injuries or trades.

Our findings support the hypothesis that successful teams exhibit distinct network signatures. The championship-winning roster shows characteristics consistent with robust network design principles: moderate centralization that avoids over-dependence on single players, balanced salary distribution that prevents excessive inequality, and strong community structure that maintains functionality even when key nodes are removed.

\subsection{Practical Applications for NBA Teams}

The network framework developed in this research offers several practical applications for NBA front offices and coaching staffs:

\textbf{Roster Construction Strategy:} Teams can use network metrics to evaluate potential acquisitions not just on individual merit but on how players fit within the existing roster structure. A high-value player who disrupts network balance may provide less benefit than expected based on individual statistics alone.

\textbf{Injury Risk Management:} Robustness simulations can identify vulnerable roster configurations before injuries occur. Teams with low resilience scores for specific scenarios can proactively address depth concerns or adjust rotation patterns to mitigate risk.

\textbf{Trade Evaluation:} Network analysis provides additional context for trade decisions by modeling how roster changes affect team stability and chemistry. The framework can quantify the hidden costs of removing well-connected role players or the benefits of acquiring players who enhance network cohesion.

\textbf{Salary Allocation Optimization:} The relationship between salary distribution geometry and team performance offers guidance for contract negotiations and budget allocation. Teams can optimize their spending patterns to achieve better network properties within salary cap constraints.

\subsection{Methodological Considerations}

Several methodological aspects warrant discussion. First, our focus on four teams provides detailed case study analysis but limits generalizability. Future research should expand to full league analysis across multiple seasons to validate findings and identify consistent patterns.

Second, the definition of "optimal" network topology remains context-dependent. Different team styles, coaching philosophies, and strategic approaches may benefit from different network configurations. The framework should be adapted to account for these stylistic variations.

Third, our edge construction based solely on shared playing time may not capture all relevant player interactions. Alternative approaches might incorporate passing frequency, defensive assignments, or other game-specific relationship measures to provide richer network representations.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

This research faces several limitations that suggest directions for future investigation:

\textbf{Sample Size:} The analysis of four teams provides insufficient statistical power for strong causal claims. Expanding to full league analysis across multiple seasons would strengthen findings and enable more robust statistical inference.

\textbf{Temporal Dynamics:} Our static network approach does not capture how roster relationships evolve throughout a season. Dynamic network analysis could reveal how team chemistry develops and changes over time.

\textbf{Performance Integration:} Future work should more directly integrate on-court performance metrics with network topology. This would enable stronger connections between structural properties and actual game outcomes.

\textbf{Cross-Sport Applications:} The framework could be adapted for other team sports with salary cap systems, such as the NFL or NHL, to test generalizability across different competitive environments.

\textbf{Predictive Modeling:} Developing real-time predictive models that incorporate network metrics alongside traditional statistics could provide valuable insights for in-season decision making.

\subsection{Broader Impact on Sports Analytics}

This research contributes to the growing intersection between network science and sports analytics. By demonstrating that roster construction can be understood through network principles, we open new avenues for quantitative team building strategies. The approach also highlights the importance of considering systemic properties rather than focusing solely on individual player metrics.

The reproducible research framework developed here enables broader adoption and validation by other researchers and practitioners. The open-source pipeline facilitates extension to different leagues, sports, and analytical questions, promoting collaborative development in the sports analytics community.

\section{Conclusion}

This research introduces a novel network-theoretic framework for analyzing NBA roster construction that reveals important insights about team building strategies and performance stability. By modeling rosters as salary-weighted graphs and examining their topological properties, we demonstrate that successful teams exhibit distinct network signatures characterized by balanced structure and robust connectivity patterns.

Our key contributions include: (1) establishing theoretical foundations for network-based roster analysis, (2) developing computational methods for quantifying roster resilience through robustness simulations, (3) creating synthetic benchmarking approaches for optimal roster generation, and (4) providing an open-source reproducible research pipeline for broader adoption.

The findings suggest that network topology provides valuable complementary information to traditional basketball analytics. Teams with superior network properties demonstrate greater resilience to player disruptions and stronger playoff performance, indicating that roster "geometry" plays a meaningful role in team success.

For NBA practitioners, this framework offers actionable insights for roster construction, trade evaluation, and salary allocation strategies. The ability to quantify roster resilience before disruptions occur enables proactive team management and risk mitigation.

Future research should expand the analysis to encompass full league data across multiple seasons, develop dynamic network models that capture temporal evolution, and integrate network metrics with real-time performance prediction systems. Cross-sport applications could validate the generalizability of network principles in team building.

As sports analytics continues to evolve toward more sophisticated analytical approaches, network science provides powerful tools for understanding the complex relational dynamics that drive team performance. This research represents an initial step toward network-informed team building strategies that complement and extend traditional player-focused analytics.

The reproducible nature of this research enables validation, extension, and improvement by the broader sports analytics community. We encourage other researchers to build upon this foundation and explore the rich intersection between network science and competitive team sports.
